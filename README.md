# Prompts in LangChain

This repository demonstrates how to create and use prompt templates with LangChain for various NLP tasks. It includes structured prompt construction, dynamic UI input handling, and chaining components like message history and chat models.
This project is especially helpful for building and testing **custom prompts** using both closed-source and **free open-source models** like those from Hugging Face.
